            I'm Maryam Guppy and I am currently a student in the University of Texas boot camp studying the MERN stack.  I graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in Information Systems.  Once I graduated, I moved to Kansas City and worked for a company called Cerner, where I was an implementation consultant.  I later took an IT Audit job in Austin and have been in the audit field for over 5 years.  After much consideration, I have decided to switch my career focus to be more technical and am really looking forward to finding a job in the Web Development field!
